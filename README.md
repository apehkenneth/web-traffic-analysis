# Web Traffic Analysis

#### The goal is to understand the traffic better, in particular the volume and distribution of events, and to develop ideas on how to increase the links' click rates. With that in mind, The data was analyzed using plain SQL statements as well as the Python Pandas and SciPy libraries.

# Questions:

1.  How many total pageview events did the links in the provided dataset receive in the full period, how many per day?
2.  What about the other recorded events?
3.  Which countries did the pageviews come from?
4.  What was the overall click rate (clicks/pageviews)?
5. How does the click rate distribute across different links?
6. Is there any correlation between clicks and previews on a link? 


# Dataset
#### The [traffic.db](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15_LNjgSfAVsGFiSnsBK8Crl16fUpbQrk/view?usp=sharing) SQLite database contains the web traffic data ("events") from a few different pages ("links") over 7 days including various categorical dimensions about the geographic origin of that traffic as well as a page's content.
